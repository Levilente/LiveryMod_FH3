# Publishing a release

The release must contain **only the DLL** as an asset.

1. Build (see the README): the result is `build/LiveryMod.dll`.
2. Test the DLL in game once, **without** hot reload (the platform's `fh3-mods\platform.log` should show the mod's lines without errors).
3. Make sure the version in `CMakeLists.txt` (`project(... VERSION x.y.z)`), `CHANGELOG.md` and the tag agree (current: `1.2.0`). The platform's update check compares the GitHub release tag (a leading `v` is ignored) with the version the mod registers.
4. Tag and publish:

```sh
git tag v1.2.0
git push origin v1.2.0
gh release create v1.2.0 build/LiveryMod.dll --title "Livery Decals for FH3 1.2.0" --notes-file release-notes.md
```

`release-notes.md` can be the matching section of [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) plus the requirements line from the README (FH3 Mod Platform 1.2.0 or newer). Do not attach source archives, ini files or anything else; GitHub adds the source zip by itself.

The DLL is build output and is listed in `.gitignore`; it is never committed.
